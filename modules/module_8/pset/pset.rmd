```

## Problem 1
Following what we did earlier on Friday, import the data for your project into
a SummarizedExperiment or SinglecellExperiment object.

For people who want to use scanpy, you could use scanpy in a jupyter notebook to answer these questions instead.

```{r}
# GEO accession
geo_acc <- "GSEXXXXXXX"

# Import the data
# Your code here
```

## Problem 2
What are the columns of your sample metadata and what do they mean?
How many samples are in your dataset?

```{r}
```
